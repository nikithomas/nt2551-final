The second part then went into actual coding through list manipulation.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Homework 2: The beginning of the assignment focused on sorting algorithms and    their associated time complexities. The second coding part of the assignment    involved running a physics simulation, and then implementing the beginning     os a machine learning project that would completed over the course of the semester.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Homework 3: Involved learning about recursion and implementing it through percolation.    In addition, the machine learning library was further developed.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Midterm: The midterm was focused on image alteration through the implementation     of three methods: object filtering, conversion to grayscale, and horizontal flip.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Homework 4: This homework served as an introduction to object oriented programming,     through the creation of a class with students and assignments.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Homework 5: This assignment involved the completion of the machine learning    library that was worked on throughout the course of the semester.</p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p>Out of all the assignments, my favorite was the first one. Even though it was    difficult to do as a beginer, I felt as though it really helped develop an understanding    of the fundamental principles of python that would be used for the remainder of the course.</p>    </body></html>
